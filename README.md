# automated-tests
In automated-tests in API TEST CASES-Assist-Masterclass-exercise you will find the API TEST CASES.

In automated-tests in Assist-Masterclass-exercise-Test Cases Documentation you will find the documentation for the test cases, xlsm, word document for the review of the SOW, printscreens and videos.(You can enable editing for "Assist_masterclass_exercise documentation test cases.xlsm" because inside the file for the row 5 columns I and J and row 10 columns I and J, I created a scrollbar because of the big content in the cells).
In the same xlsm file you will also find the extra test cases, they start from the row 7 to 10 included.


In automated-tests in cypress in the e2e folder -Assist-Masterclass-exercise folder, you will find the automated test cases.
